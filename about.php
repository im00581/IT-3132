            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>Cinnamon met Herb while she was manning her stall at the Savannah Farmers Market. At the time, both were looking for something new and interesting to spice up their lives. </p>
			<p>Herb became a regular at Cinnamonâ€™s stall, and they bonded over healthy recipes and bemoaning the fact that there were no good vegetarian restaurants in Savannah. They dreamed of opening their own shop where they could serve the community in Savannah both delicious and healthy food.</p>
	<p>Ten years ago, Herb and Cinnamon Willow decided to put their dream into action. They bought a shop in the historic district in Savannah, close to the place where they first met, and out of that choice came Daily Delights. The restaurant aims for healthy eating above all else, and buys fruits and vegetables from local farmers to fulfill that goal (including the wonderful farmers who frequent the Savannah Farmers Market!)</P>
	<p>Now Daily Delights is opening a new location near Georgia Southern University to continue sharing their recipes and delicious food. Come check us out for a snack to go, or a meal in house!
